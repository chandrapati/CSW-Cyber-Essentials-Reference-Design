# Cisco Secure Workload — UK Cyber Essentials **Plus**
## Reference Design | UK Organisations & Government Supply Chain

**Version:** 1.0  
**Scheme reference:** NCSC Cyber Essentials (requirements for IT infrastructure — align artefacts to your certification body’s current scheme document)  
**Use Case:** Fresh install, hybrid environment (on-prem + cloud)  
**Certification track:** **Cyber Essentials Plus** (includes **hands-on technical verification** by an assessor — not self-assessment alone)

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** UK organisations pursuing or maintaining **Cyber Essentials Plus**, especially those bidding for **UK government contracts** where the scheme is mandated or strongly expected. Security and infrastructure teams preparing for **external assessment**, internal IT preparing **evidence packs**, and programme managers who need a **technical narrative** that goes beyond the scheme’s minimum paperwork.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *For the **Firewalls** control, can I show **deny-by-default** enforcement and **documented boundaries** between internal zones—not only perimeter appliances?* (CE1)
- *For **Secure configuration**, can I prove what software is installed, detect **configuration drift**, and spot **unnecessary services** still listening?* (CE2)
- *For **User access control**, can I tie **east-west reachability** to **least privilege** and surface **privileged process activity** on sensitive servers?* (CE3)
- *For **Malware protection**, can I complement AV/EDR with **unseen-process detection**, **forensic rules**, and **lateral-movement containment**?* (CE4)
- *For **Patch / security update management**, can I prioritise **unpatched CVEs** with **EPSS and reachability**, and maintain a **live software inventory**?* (CE5)
- *For **Plus**, what **technical artefacts** support the assessor’s **on-site / remote verification** and **vulnerability scans**—without replacing the certification body’s test plan?*

**What you'll need.** Scope of **in-scope devices** per your certification body, change windows for sensor install, a CMDB or cloud asset inventory for reconciliation, patch ticketing, and (for Plus) coordination with your **Cyber Essentials Plus assessor** on test windows.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 to align scope; 3–4 for sensor and inventory; 5–6 for baseline visibility; 7–8 for policy design and enforcement; section 9 for **audit / evidence** ahead of assessment; section 10 for **boundaries** so you do not over-claim against the scheme.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- CE1 workload-level firewall enforcement proof
- CE2 secure configuration baseline from agent inventory
- CE5 patch management evidence scoped to workloads

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

**Cyber Essentials** is a **UK government–endorsed** baseline certification. It does not replace ISO 27001, NIS2, or deep red-teaming—but it is often **contractually required** for public-sector supply chain work. **Cyber Essentials Plus** adds **independent technical verification** (including **penetration-style testing** and hands-on checks by an assessor) on top of the **Cyber Essentials** self-assessment questionnaire. CSW is **not** a certification body; it **produces technical evidence and controls** that often **exceed** the scheme minimum, demonstrating **security maturity** to auditors, customers, and internal risk committees.

### Scheme structure vs. CSW (five technical themes)

The NCSC scheme organises requirements into **five technical control areas**. This reference design labels them **CE1–CE5** for cross-reference to implementation plans. Your assessor’s materials may order or word them slightly differently—map row-for-row to their checklist.

| Cyber Essentials theme | CSW role | Evidence focus |
|---|---|---|
| **CE1 — Firewalls & Internet gateways** | **Direct (workload firewall)** — host-based **microsegmentation** enforces **deny-by-default** between zones; complements perimeter firewalls | Allow/deny rule exports, simulation vs enforcement reports, boundary diagrams backed by **observed** flows |
| **CE2 — Secure configuration** | **Direct (visibility + drift)** — **software inventory** (packages/versions); **baseline / drift** detection; **process & listener** visibility for unnecessary services | Inventory exports, drift alerts, listener reports |
| **CE3 — User access control** | **Supporting → strong with identity integration** — **identity-aware segmentation** restricts which users/processes can reach which workloads; **process context** surfaces **privileged** use | Policy tied to identity labels; ADM with user context where available |
| **CE4 — Malware protection** | **Complementary** — CSW does **not** replace **anti-malware**; **process monitoring** detects **anomalous / unseen** binaries; **forensic rules** flag suspicious patterns; **microsegmentation** limits **lateral movement** | Process anomaly alerts, forensic timeline exports, containment evidence |
| **CE5 — Security update management** | **Direct (prioritisation + inventory)** — **CVE awareness** and **EPSS**; **software inventory** tracks patch levels; **reachability analysis** prioritises exposed unpatched workloads | Vulnerability + reachability reports, risk-ranked backlogs |

### Cyber Essentials vs. Cyber Essentials Plus (assessment model)

| Aspect | Cyber Essentials (basic) | Cyber Essentials Plus |
|---|---|---|
| Assessment style | **Self-assessment questionnaire** + declaration | **Hands-on technical verification** by accredited assessor |
| Testing | Organiser attests controls | **Internal/external technical checks**, malware delivery tests, etc. (per assessor plan) |
| CSW’s role | Evidence preparation for answers | **Live enforcement and telemetry** during assessor activity; **pre/post** flow and policy exports |

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW sensors on **in-scope** systems:

- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-prem) is provisioned and reachable from workloads (**HTTPS 443** outbound typical)
- [ ] **In-scope asset list** agreed with certification body (servers, laptops, firewalls—per scheme version)
- [ ] Linux/Windows sensor compatibility verified for all **Plus candidate** workloads
- [ ] Cloud accounts connected (**AWS, Azure, GCP**) via CSW cloud connectors where applicable
- [ ] Stakeholders: IT operations, security, **assessment lead**, change management
- [ ] **Monitoring-only** phase approved before enforcement (recommended)
- [ ] Baseline change-freeze or tagging convention agreed (e.g. `compliance:cyber-essentials-plus`)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 On-premises workloads

**Install software sensors:**

```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Alma)
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb

# Verify agent service (name may vary slightly by package); example:
sudo systemctl status tet-sensor
# or
sudo systemctl status csw-agent
```

**Windows:** install the MSI supplied for your CSW release; confirm the service is **Running** and reporting to the correct cluster URL.

**Initial posture (recommended):**

- Enforcement: **Monitoring only** until baselines exist
- Enable **process hash**, **network flow**, and **vulnerability** telemetry where licensed
- Apply tags: `env:production`, `compliance:cyber-essentials-plus`, `ce-scope:in`

### 3.2 Cloud workloads

**Option A — Sensor on every in-scope VM:** same as on-prem.

**Option B — Cloud connectors (agentless breadth):**

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Add AWS / Azure / GCP connector
  → Least-privilege IAM / service principal
  → Enable flow-related ingestion per connector documentation
```

### 3.3 Sensor validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Status: Active for all in-scope hosts
  → Version alignment across cluster
  → Confirm telemetry indicators (flows / inventory updating)
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & inventory design (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Scope architecture (UK enterprise pattern)

Design scopes around **trust zones** and **data sensitivity**—mirroring how you describe **firewall zones** to an assessor:

```
Root
└── UK-Org
    ├── CE-In-Scope-Production
    │   ├── App-Servers
    │   ├── DB-Servers
    │   └── Admin-Jump-Hosts
    ├── Corporate-Standard
    ├── Development (often out of CE scope—confirm with assessor)
    └── Partner-Connectivity
```

### 4.2 Auto-discovery filters (examples)

```
Filter: DB-Listeners
  - Process: mysqld, postgres, sqlservr, oracle
  - Ports: 3306, 5432, 1433, 1521

Filter: High-Risk-Services
  - Ports: 22, 3389, 445, 135, 5985
```

### 4.3 Labelling strategy

| Label key | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ce-scope` | in, out | In-scope for certification boundary |
| `env` | production, dev | Separates test systems |
| `tier` | web, app, data | Segmentation policy grouping |
| `owner` | team name | Accountability |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility & baseline (Days 11–25)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)

ADM builds the **observed network map** assessors expect you to understand—useful for **CE1** (boundaries) and **CE5** (what is reachable from where).

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → New workspace: "UK-CE-Plus-ADM"
  → Scope: CE-In-Scope-Production
  → Window: 2–4 weeks (include payroll / month-end if applicable)
  → Enable process context (and user context if sensors support)
```

### 5.2 Baseline and secure configuration (CE2)

| Activity | CSW capability | Assessor-relevant output |
|---|---|---|
| Software inventory | Installed packages / versions | Export per workload |
| Drift from gold image | Baseline deviation detection | Drift incidents with timestamps |
| Unnecessary services | Listening processes | Listener report by scope |

Document **who approves** baseline changes in your change tool—CSW surfaces *what* changed; **policy** records *who authorised* it.

### 5.3 Patch posture visibility (CE5)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerabilities (or Vulnerability Report — per release)
  → Scope: CE-In-Scope-Production
  → Sort by CVSS / exploit intel / EPSS where available
  → Add reachability context (exposed to untrusted networks?)
```

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy design (Days 26–40)

Translate **Cyber Essentials** intent into **CSW segmentation** workspaces. **Perimeter firewalls** remain in scope for CE1; CSW proves **workload-level** enforcement **inside** the boundary.

### 6.1 Policy themes (conceptual)

**Deny-by-default matrix (CE1 / lateral containment):**

```
DENY: Any → DB-Tier (default deny inbound)
DENY: App-Tier → Internet (except approved proxy / patch endpoints)
DENY: Corporate-Standard → CE-In-Scope-Production (except jump host paths)
```

**Allowlists (least privilege — CE3 alignment):**

```
ALLOW: App-Servers → DB-Servers (tcp/1433 or tcp/5432 — prefer TLS/native encryption per app)
ALLOW: Admin-Jump-Hosts → App-Servers (tcp/22, tcp/3389)
ALLOW: CE-In-Scope-Production → Approved-Patch-Mirrors (tcp/443)
```

**Plaintext and risky protocol detection (pairs with CE2/CE4 narratives):**

```
ALERT or DENY: sensitive scopes using cleartext where TLS is mandated
  (e.g. HTTP to admin interfaces, legacy SMB patterns — tune to your standard)
```

### 6.2 Policy workspace setup

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → New workspace: "UK-CE-Plus-Enforcement"
  → Scope: CE-In-Scope-Production
  → Import ADM-suggested policies → reconcile with intended architecture
  → Phase: Simulation → Enforcement (staged)
```

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Enforcement (Days 41–60+)

### 7.1 Recommended progression

| Stage | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| A | Simulation | 2–3 weeks | Tune rules before assessor visit |
| B | Enforce **obvious** deny rules | 1 week | Close high-risk paths |
| C | Full enforcement | Ongoing | Production baseline for Plus |

### 7.2 During Plus technical verification

- Maintain a **read-only** export of **active policies** dated the assessment window
- Capture **assessor IP ranges** only if your assessor instructs you to allow test traffic—**do not** weaken production security without written agreement
- Run **flow search** filtered to **test interval** to narrate any blocked or allowed tester activity

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Monitoring, alerting & audit evidence

### 8.1 Alert catalogue (examples)

| Alert | CSW signal | CE mapping |
|---|---|---|
| New listener on sensitive tier | Listener delta | CE2 |
| Deny hit on production policy | Enforcement log | CE1 / CE3 |
| Unseen process hash | Process anomaly | CE4 |
| Critical CVE on internet-exposed workload | Vuln + reachability | CE5 |
| East-west path to DB from new source | Flow novelty | CE1 / CE3 |

### 8.2 Evidence for certification and annual refresh

| Evidence item | CSW source | Typical CE mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Segmentation / firewall rule set | Policy workspace export | CE1 |
| Inventory of software & versions | Inventory export | CE2 / CE5 |
| Baseline drift report | Drift / configuration modules | CE2 |
| Vulnerability backlog with prioritisation | Vuln report + EPSS / exposure | CE5 |
| Flow logs with process attribution | Flow search export | CE1–CE5 (investigations) |
| Incident reconstruction bundle | Process + flow timeline | CE4 / IR |

Retain evidence per your **legal / records** policy; Cyber Essentials does not specify log retention as HIPAA does—align to **NCSC / internal** standards.

---

## 9. Control-by-control mapping (requirement → capability → evidence)

Use this table as the **crosswalk** for your **evidence register**. Wording of official requirements must track your assessor’s **current** scheme document.

| UK CE theme | Representative scheme intent (summary) | CSW capability | Evidence produced |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CE1 Firewalls** | Boundary protection; **default deny**; controlled inbound/outbound | Host-based **microsegmentation**; zone-to-zone **deny-by-default**; ADM-backed rules | Policy export; simulation vs enforcement report; ADM diagram; deny-hit statistics |
| **CE2 Secure configuration** | Harden systems; remove/disable unnecessary software & services | **Software inventory**; **baseline drift**; **process/listener** visibility | Inventory CSV; drift incidents; listener reports |
| **CE3 User access control** | Least privilege accounts; controlled admin access | **Identity-aware** policies (where integrated); constrained **east-west** paths; **privileged process** visibility | Identity-scoped rules; ADM with user context; process reports for admin tools |
| **CE4 Malware protection** | Anti-malware / appropriate alternative controls | **Complement AV**: unseen binary detection; **forensic detection** rules; **segmentation** limiting spread | Alert history; process tree exports; blocked lateral paths |
| **CE5 Security updates** | Patch **high/critical** issues in defined timeframes | **CVE** inventory; **EPSS** prioritisation; **reachability** scoring; correlation to inventory | Risk-ranked CVE report; “exposed unpatched” dashboard export |

---

## 10. Boundaries — what CSW does **not** cover

- **Certification decision** — only your **accredited Cyber Essentials/Cyber Essentials Plus** assessor certifies compliance.
- **Questionnaire completion** — administrative attestation remains your responsibility.
- **Perimeter appliance configuration** — CSW does not replace **corporate firewalls**, WAFs, or router ACLs; it **complements** them with **host enforcement**.
- **Anti-malware product** — CSW is **not** a replacement for **supported AV/EDR** required by CE4; it adds **behavioural** and **network containment** evidence.
- **MFA, IAM, and account lifecycle** — CE3 requires **organisational** IAM processes; CSW enforces **network** reachability consistent with those decisions.
- **Patch deployment** — CSW **identifies** and **prioritises**; **WSUS**, **SCCM**, **patch orchestration** tools perform installation.
- **Physical security and supplier contracts** — outside product scope.

---

## 11. Audit preparation & evidence export (worked examples)

### 11.1 CLI / API patterns (illustrative)

Many teams export via UI; automate where possible:

```bash
# Example: periodic inventory pull via your CSW automation (replace with official API/CLI for your version)
# curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CSW_API_TOKEN}" \
#   "${CSW_API_BASE}/v1/inventory/workloads?scope=CE-In-Scope-Production" \
#   -o "evidence/inventory-$(date +%F).json"
```

Store exports in an **immutable** evidence bucket (WORM / object lock) if your GRC team requires it.

### 11.2 SIEM forwarding (optional)

Forward **flow / enforcement / alert** metadata to Splunk / Sentinel / Chronicle to correlate with **firewall** and **EDR** logs for **Plus** interviews.
